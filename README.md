# OneLine
## WARNING: I hold no responsibility for any negative side effects produced by looking at this dumpster fire of a program. Observe at your own risk.

Back in high school, after learning about ternaries, I started using them everywhere.
Then I decided to see how far I could take it, and fit as much program as I could into one line.
The only problems were that 
A) I had no clue what I was doing
B) This was in Java.
The result of this experiment is this program, which I believe to be one of, if not the worst single program ever created.
It has bad programming practices, worse documenting (it's so bad I don't even know where to begin commenting it), enough crimes against humanity to make Charles Babbage regret making the forefather to the computers, and the power to confuse even the compiler. This thing works perfectly on some java versions, breaks instantly on others, and on some, breaks if you wait too long to input values. I'd fix it, except I can't even read it.
